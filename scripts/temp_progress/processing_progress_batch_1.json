      "abstract": "We study pairs of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories that share the same vacuum moduli space and the same chiral field content, encoded by a common quiver, but differ in their superpotentials. These theories arise as worldvolume theories on a D3-brane probing a toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold and admit a description in terms of bipartite graphs on a 2-torus, known as brane tilings. Using an explicit example, we show that the correspondence is realized by a single `tilting' mutation along the diagonals of hexagonal faces in the brane tiling, which is equivalent to a specific sequence of Seiberg dualities performed at distinct gauge nodes in the quiver.",

      "abstract": "This paper is devoted to the quantum integrable structure of Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models, formed by an infinite number of commuting Integrals of Motion (IMs) in their current algebra. Focusing for simplicity on the SU(2) case, we obtain the first four commuting higher-spin local IMs, starting from a general SU(2)-invariant ansatz and imposing their commutativity. We further show evidence of their commutativity with quantum non-local IMs, which were already built in the literature as Kondo defects. We then investigate the diagonalization of these local operators on $\\widehat{\\mathfrak{su}(2)}_k$ Verma modules: we explicitly find the first few eigenvectors and further discuss the affine Bethe ansatz and ODE/IQFT conjectures, which predict the full eigenstates and spectrum of the integrable structure. Our results show a perfect match between the direct diagonalization and these overarching conjectures. We conclude by discussing several outlooks, including multi-current generalisations, massive deformations and a general long-term program towards the first principle quantisation of 2-dimensional integrable sigma-models.",

      "abstract": "The classical Rees construction (of common use in commutative algebra and Hodge theory) interpolates between filtrations, viewed as ${\\mathbb G}_m$-equivariant vector bundles on the affine line, and their associated gradings. Various non-abelian versions have been proposed, where the multiplicative group ${\\mathbb G}_m$ is replaced by an arbitrary reductive group. Building on a construction due to P. O'Sullivan, we present a Galois correspondence between quasi-homogeneous spaces and certain monoidal categories, and apply it to monoidal categories of motives with concrete applications to algebraic cycles. In particular, we give a new proof and generalization of the Clozel-Deligne theorem about numerical equivalence on abelian varieties over finite fields.",

We define a $q$-deformation of the Tsetlin library by replacing the symmetric group action on permutations by the action of the type $A$ Iwahori-Hecke algebra. We compute the stationary distribution and spectrum of this Markov chain by relating it to a Markov chain on complete flags over the finite field vector space $\\mathbb{F}_q^n$ and applying techniques from semigroup theory. We also generalize the $q$-Tsetlin library to words (with repeated letters), and compute its stationary distribution and spectrum.",
