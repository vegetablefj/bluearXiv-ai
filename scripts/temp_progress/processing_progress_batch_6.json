      "abstract": "We study pairs of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories that share the same vacuum moduli space and the same chiral field content, encoded by a common quiver, but differ in their superpotentials. These theories arise as worldvolume theories on a D3-brane probing a toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold and admit a description in terms of bipartite graphs on a 2-torus, known as brane tilings. Using an explicit example, we show that the correspondence is realized by a single `tilting' mutation along the diagonals of hexagonal faces in the brane tiling, which is equivalent to a specific sequence of Seiberg dualities performed at distinct gauge nodes in the quiver.",

Focusing for simplicity on the SU(2) case, we obtain the first four commuting higher-spin local IMs, starting from a general SU(2)-invariant ansatz and imposing their commutativity. We further show evidence of their commutativity with quantum non-local IMs, which were already built in the literature as Kondo defects. We then investigate the diagonalization of these local operators on $\\widehat{\\mathfrak{su}(2)}_k$ Verma modules: we explicitly find the first few eigenvectors and further discuss the affine Bethe ansatz and ODE/IQFT conjectures, which predict the full eigenstates and spectrum of the integrable structure. Our results show a perfect match between the direct diagonalization and these overarching conjectures. We conclude by discussing several outlooks, including multi-current generalisations, massive deformations and a general long-term program towards the first principle quantisation of 2-dimensional integrable sigma-models.",

This identifiability property has been established in the literature for a large class of networks, to which our results apply immediately, while it is conjectural for others. The theory we develop is grounded in an abstract formalism, and is therefore architecture-agnostic.

Building on work of Dawson and Cavalieri, who defined and computed tropical Tevelev degrees in the case of degree $d = g+1$ and $n = g+3$ marked points, we extend the theory by introducing an additional integer parameter $\\ell$. In our framework the curve degree and number of marked points vary as $d = g + 1 + \\ell$ and $n = g + 3 + 2\\ell$, and we analyze the resulting tropical Tevelev degrees for both positive and negative values of $\\ell$. This tropicalizes results of Cela, Pandharipande, and Schmitt on algebraic Tevelev degrees. We then further broaden the framework by introducing generalized tropical Tevelev degrees, providing the tropical counterpart to the generalized Tevelev degrees studied by Cela and Lian. These results establish a wider set of computational and structural patterns for intersection calculations on tropical moduli spaces and reveal new behavior beyond the classical setting.",

We give new proofs for the facts that the category of perverse sheaves of middle perversity on complex-analytic manifolds with suitable conditions on the stratification is highest weight and that the derived coherent category of any Grassmannian has a $t$-structure with highest weight heart. Also we show that the abelian null category of any proper birational morphism of regular surfaces is highest weight. For this null category, we give a geometric description of some special objects related to the highest weight structure, such as standard, costandard and characteristic tilting objects.",

In contrast, we demonstrate with examples in both zero and non-zero characteristic of the base field that the class of exact module categories is not stable under this product. We also observe in examples that fully exact module categories form a dense subset in the class of exact ones.\nThe monoidal 2-category of fully exact module categories strictly contains those of invertible and separable module categories. In fact, we show that each internal algebra of a fully exact module category is projectively separable, a generalization of separable algebras involving projective objects. In the semisimple case, a module category is fully exact if and only if it is separable.\nIn general, fully exact module categories are not dualizable inside their class, but if they are, they are fully dualizable objects in the monoidal 2-category of finite module categories. We call such module categories perfect. We show that perfect module categories form a rigid monoidal 2-subcategory containing all fully dualizable objects. Therefore, we propose perfect module categories as a model for finite tensor 2-categories. If the braiding is symmetric, a module category is fully exact if and only if it is perfect.\nAs a detailed example, we classify fully exact, and hence perfect, module categories over the symmetric tensor category of modules over Sweedler's four-dimensional Hopf algebra and compute their relative Deligne products, and the categories of 1-morphisms. For a general quasi-triangular Hopf algebra, we analyze when the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces is fully exact. We show that this is not the case for both Sweedler's Hopf algebra and Lusztig's factorizable small quantum group of type $A_1$ at an odd root of unity.",
